                <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                <p>
                    Swing into the action at our Monkey Jungle, home to some of the most clever, curious, and energetic animals in the zoo. This lively exhibit is designed to mimic lush forest environments, complete with ropes, branches, and climbing platforms where our primates can leap, play, and interact. Watch them groom, forage, and swing through the treetops while learning about their unique behaviors and social bonds. Whether you're laughing at their antics or marveling at their intelligence, the Monkey Jungle is a favorite for visitors of all ages.

                    Scattered throughout the park are picnic areas with tables and benches, ideal for a quiet lunch or snack. Some zones are covered for sun protection, while others let you soak in the fresh air under the open sky. You’ll also find plenty of comfortable seating, from rustic wooden chairs to modern stone benches, all surrounded by natural beauty.
