                <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                <p>
                    Take a break from the animal excitement and unwind in our beautifully landscaped Zoo Park. Nestled in the heart of the zoo, this peaceful green space offers the perfect setting for families and visitors to relax, recharge, and enjoy the outdoors. With shady trees, wide open lawns, and clean, well-kept paths, it’s a calm escape from the busier exhibits.

                    Scattered throughout the park are picnic areas with tables and benches, ideal for a quiet lunch or snack. Some zones are covered for sun protection, while others let you soak in the fresh air under the open sky. You’ll also find plenty of comfortable seating, from rustic wooden chairs to modern stone benches, all surrounded by natural beauty.
