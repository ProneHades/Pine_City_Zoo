                <h3>WILD THINGS COFFEE SHOP</h3>
                <p>
                    Tucked into the heart of the zoo’s bustling food court, the Wild Things Coffee Shop offers a relaxing retreat for animal lovers and families on the go. With shaded outdoor seating and views of nearby enclosures, it’s the perfect spot to take a break between exhibits. The shop blends eco-friendly design with safari-themed décor — think bamboo counters, animal-print accents, and a mural of jungle wildlife. Whether you're recharging after a long walk or grabbing a quick caffeine fix before the next adventure, The Roasted Bean brings specialty coffee and fresh snacks to the wild side.
